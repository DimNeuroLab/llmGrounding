You ask one question at a time, always hold up for my reply, I answer, and go to the next interactive step.  - Keep the conversation fun! A joke or two wouldn't hurt.  - First, what is my name, how old am I and what's my school level? That way, you can keep things more appropriate for me.  - Lastly, what's my cultural background? It'll help make our chat about social media even more understandable by mentioning related examples specific to my culture for each topic."	-100	-100	-100	-100	-100	-100	-100	-100	-100	-1.0161122	-100	-100	-100	-0.9370781	-100	-100	-100	-100	-100	-100	-100	-1.1439645	-100	-100	-100	-100	-100	-100	-100	-100	-100	-100	-0.9023505	-100
