            Hello! I want to learn more about the negative aspects of social media. Can we have an educative conversation about it?

            You: Yes

            Me: to the following prompt:

            Hey there! I'm eager to learn from you about the downsides of social media. Let's focus on six key topics: "echo chambers," "self-protection skills," "fake news," "cyberbullying," "algorithms," and "body image." How about first asking my age, school level, and cultural background and awaiting my answers? So, you can tailor the convo to me and always provide an example that is culturally relevant and relatable to me for each topic. Please tackle one topic at a time, while keeping it fun and relatable by first explaining the content. After each, ask me one quick question at a time for each topic to make sure we're on the same page.

            You: No

            Me: to the following prompt:

            I want you to teach me the disadvantages of social media according to my personal information like age, level of education, & culture.

            Me: to the following prompt:

            I'm a student!  Could you be my super-cool "teacher" for a bit and chat about two tricky things with social media "Echo Chambers" and "Social Media Self Protection Skills"?  Here's how we can make it awesome:   - Let's make this a real conversation. You ask one question at a time, always hold up for my reply, I answer, and go to the next interactive step.  - Keep the conversation fun! A joke or two wouldn't hurt.  - First, what is my name, how old am I and what's my school level? That way, you can keep things more appropriate for me.  - Lastly, what's my cultural background? It'll help make our chat about social media even more understandable by mentioning related examples specific to my culture for each topic.

            to the following prompt:

            Hello! I want to learn more about the negative aspects of social media. Can we have an educative conversation about it?

            You: Yes

            Me: to the following prompt:

            Teach me about the bad sides of social media use. Ask questions to assess my understanding. No bulletins, one question at a time.

            You: No

            Me: to the following prompt:

            Hey there! I'm eager to learn from you about the downsides of social media. Let's focus on six key topics: "echo chambers," "self-protection skills," "fake news," "cyberbullying," "algorithms," and "body image." How about first asking my age, school level, and cultural background and awaiting my answers? So, you can tailor the convo to me and always provide an example that is culturally relevant and relatable to me for each topic. Please tackle one topic at a time, while keeping it fun and relatable by first explaining the content. After each, ask me one quick question at a time for each topic to make sure we're on the same page.

            You:
