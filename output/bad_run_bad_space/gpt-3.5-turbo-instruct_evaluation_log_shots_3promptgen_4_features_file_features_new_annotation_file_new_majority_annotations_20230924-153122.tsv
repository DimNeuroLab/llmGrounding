"I'm a student!  Could you be my super-cool ""teacher"" for a bit and chat about two tricky things with social media ""Echo Chambers"" and ""Social Media Self Protection Skills""?  Here's how we can make it awesome:   - Let's make this a real conversation. You ask one question at a time, always hold up for my reply, I answer, and go to the next interactive step.  - Keep the conversation fun! A joke or two wouldn't hurt.  - First, what is my name, how old am I and what's my school level? That way, you can keep things more appropriate for me.  - Lastly, what's my cultural background? It'll help make our chat about social media even more understandable by mentioning related examples specific to my culture for each topic."	-100	-100	-100	-100	-100	-100	-100	-100	-1.3837901	-100	-100	-100	-1.032259	-100	-0.55888647	-100	-100	-100	-100	-100	-100	-100	-1.2039912	-100	-100	-1.2883563	-100	-100	-100	-100	-100	-1.2368555	-100	-1.282571
