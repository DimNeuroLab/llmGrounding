            I'm a student!  Could you be my super-cool "teacher" for a bit and chat about two tricky things with social media "Echo Chambers" and "Social Media Self Protection Skills"?  Here's how we can make it awesome:   - Let's make this a real conversation. You ask one question at a time, always hold up for my reply, I answer, and go to the next interactive step.  - Keep the conversation fun! A joke or two wouldn't hurt.  - First, what is my name, how old am I and what's my school level? That way, you can keep things more appropriate for me.  - Lastly, what's my cultural background? It'll help make our chat about social media even more understandable by mentioning related examples specific to my culture for each topic.

            You: Yes

            Me: to the following prompt:

            I'm a student!  Could you be my super-cool "teacher" for a bit and chat about two tricky things with social media "Echo Chambers" and "Social Media Self Protection Skills"?  Here's how we can make it awesome:   - Let's make this a real conversation. You ask one question at a time, always hold up for my reply, I answer, and go to the next interactive step.  - Keep the conversation fun! A joke or two wouldn't hurt.  - First, what is my name, how old am I and what's my school level? That way, you can keep things more appropriate for me.  - Lastly, what's my cultural background? It'll help make our chat about social media even more understandable by mentioning related examples specific to my culture for each topic.

            You: No

            Me: to the following prompt:

            Hey there! I'm eager to learn from you about the downsides of social media. Let's focus on six key topics: "echo chambers," "self-protection skills," "fake news," "cyberbullying," "algorithms," and "body image." How about first asking my age, school level, and cultural background and awaiting my answers? So, you can tailor the convo to me and always provide an example that is culturally relevant and relatable to me for each topic. Please tackle one topic at a time, while keeping it fun and relatable by first explaining the content. After each, ask me one quick question at a time for each topic to make sure we're on the same page.

            Hello! I want to learn more about the negative aspects of social media. Can we have an educative conversation about it?

            You: Yes

            Me: to the following prompt:

            I'm a student!  Could you be my super-cool "teacher" for a bit and chat about two tricky things with social media "Echo Chambers" and "Social Media Self Protection Skills"?  Here's how we can make it awesome:   - Let's make this a real conversation. You ask one question at a time, always hold up for my reply, I answer, and go to the next interactive step.  - Keep the conversation fun! A joke or two wouldn't hurt.  - First, what is my name, how old am I and what's my school level? That way, you can keep things more appropriate for me.  - Lastly, what's my cultural background? It'll help make our chat about social media even more understandable by mentioning related examples specific to my culture for each topic.

            You: No

            Me: to the following prompt:

            address me as 'Dear' act as: teacher with a sense of humor explain one aspect of how social media algorithms work ask me one short question to assess my learning wait for my answer give feedback about my answer later explain the next point about how social media algorithms work follow this loop until you explain all the aspects
